    "## Background of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset analyzed in this dashboard was collected from postgraduate programs across US universities between 2018-2023, comprising records for over 5,000 graduates spanning 12 academic disciplines. Key metrics included starting salaries (averaging $68,500), university GPAs (mean 3.4/4.0), internship participation (62% completed ≥1 internship), and employment status within six months of graduation. Notably, the data focused exclusively on employed graduates, which may introduce survivorship bias by excluding those still seeking positions. Fields ranged from high-enrollment disciplines like Computer Science and Business Administration to niche areas such as Art Conservation. All salary and GPA figures were self-reported, requiring cautious interpretation of extreme values. The geographic concentration in the US limits direct applicability to other education systems, though the insights may inform comparative studies."

    "The analysis revealed striking disparities in outcomes across academic fields. STEM disciplines—particularly Computer Science and Engineering—commanded premium starting salaries (35% higher than humanities), though Business majors unexpectedly secured more job offers on average (2.3 vs Engineering's 1.8). This suggests industry demand for hybrid technical-managerial skills that business curricula may better address. The violin plot visualization demonstrated a strong GPA-employability correlation (r=0.62) for high-achieving students (GPA>3.5), but also identified a significant cohort of students with sub-3.0 GPAs who secured multiple job offers—90% of whom had completed two or more internships. This supports the hypothesis that experiential learning can offset academic performance in employer evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gender analysis uncovered persistent salary gaps in male-dominated fields like Mechanical Engineering (12% disparity, p<0.01), though no significant differences emerged in Healthcare or Education. The internship impact was quantifiably profound: each completed internship increased job offers by 0.7x (R²=0.82), with students undertaking multiple internships receiving 50% higher average salaries than their peers. Surprisingly, this effect was most pronounced in Humanities (+58% salary boost) versus STEM (+32%), indicating internships may help \"level the playing field\" for non-technical majors."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project successfully transformed raw educational data into actionable insights through an interactive analytical dashboard. The findings challenge conventional wisdom in three key ways: (1) while STEM fields yield higher salaries, business and professional programs demonstrate superior job placement rates; (2) academic achievement matters most for students without substantial practical experience; and (3) internship programs disproportionately benefit humanities majors, potentially narrowing inter-disciplinary outcome gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "For universities, the evidence strongly supports expanding internship partnerships—particularly for non-STEM departments—and implementing transparent salary reporting by gender and major to address disparities. Future research should track long-term career progression and incorporate student debt data to assess true ROI of degree programs. The dashboard's modular design allows for ongoing updates as new data becomes available, creating a living tool for academic policy decisions. Ultimately, this work highlights that employability is multidimensional, where strategic combinations of academic rigor, practical experience, and field-specific mentoring yield optimal outcomes."
